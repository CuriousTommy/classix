	// by PowerPC code or follows PowerPC code requirements (like endianness). On the opposite, functions that are
	// implemented in the Intel universe need to be bridged to the PowerPC universe, and when such a bridge is
	// necessary, we cannot perform relocations to offsets of symbols because the Intel offset will be
	// completely unrelated.

	// a symbol cannot be used.
